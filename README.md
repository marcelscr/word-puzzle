# Welcome to Worldle of Warcraft!

This repository contains a wordle-like game based on World of Warcraft characters.

## Development

To run the Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
yarn install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.

## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.
